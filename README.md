### Project Description
WrongMaps is your unreliable co-pilot, sending you to ridiculous places with equally ridiculous directions. This isn‚Äôt about getting from A to B ‚Äî it‚Äôs about the questionable journey in between.



### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Navigating to the "correct" place.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We looked at modern GPS apps and thought, ‚ÄúThese are way too accurate and helpful.‚Äù
So we fixed that problem by building a navigation system that:

Deliberately sends you in the wrong direction.

Gives directions that sound like they came from a tired stand-up comedian.

Rewards you for being lost.

Occasionally decides your ‚Äúshort trip‚Äù should now be a world tour.
